This is a hardware and software project that aims to be a logger and control 
module for a high altitude balloon or other device. 

##Hardware
There are multiple modular boards that each perform a task.   
The power board currently regulates 3-5V down to 3.3, suitable for Li-Po cells. 
It incorporates a microcontroller and switchmode regulator. Power is passed 
through a header to ease design of later modules. 

The radio board uses the Axsem (ON Semiconductor) AX5043 IC and a power amplifier
Currently it is set up for the amateur radio 2M band. The chip can do hardware 
FSK, GMFSK, AFSK and analog FM. Its a really cool chip. The PA will do a watt,
nominally. The board also includes a MCU, Freescale KL26 and GPS module on the
back. 

The main board currently will not work with the new radio as the pinout changed.
Currently it is set up for the DRA818 "Baofeng on a chip" 2m radio module. As
the data must be generated by audio, its slow and takes a lot of processing 
to use. The board will be reworked to use the new radio module after testing. 

##Software

Software is written in C with the KEIL IDE. This may change in the future 
because linux, but for now, it works. 


Feel free to take a look and contribute!
